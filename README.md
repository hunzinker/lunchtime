Tired of eating boring sandwiches for lunch? Sticky lids on yesterday's soup
containers getting you down?

Try lunchtime! It's fast. It's easy. And best of all, it's free!

Where should I go?

```bash
lunch.bash
```

Need variety?

```bash
lunch.bash -f /path/to/newline/delimited/lunchbox/file
```

See `lunchbox_example` for more information.

Lost?

```bash
lunch.bash -h
```
